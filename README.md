# DCGANs
This project is done by me in which I implemented Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new synthetic images using Fashion MNIST dataset. I used keras to implement it and the approach used in the code is based on the research paper "Unsupervised Representation  Learning with Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks".
